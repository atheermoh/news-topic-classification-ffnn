    "### Submission Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "You **must** submit a Jupyter Notebook file (assignment_yourusername.ipynb) and an exported PDF version (you can do it from Jupyter: `File->Download as->PDF via Latex`, you need to have a Latex distribution installed e.g. MikTex or MacTex and pandoc). If you are unable to export the pdf via Latex, you can print the notebook web page to a pdf file from your browser (e.g. on Firefox: File->Print->Save to PDF). Failure to submit both the .ipynb and pdf files will result in mark deductions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You are advised to follow the code structure given in this notebook by completing all given funtions. You can also write any auxilliary/helper functions (and arguments for the functions) that you might need but note that you can provide a full solution without any such functions. Similarly, you can just use only the packages imported below but you are free to use any additional functionality from the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html), NumPy, SciPy (excluding built-in softmax funtcions) and Pandas. You are **not allowed to use any third-party library** such as Scikit-learn (apart from metric functions already provided), NLTK, Spacy, Keras, Pytorch etc.. You should mention if you've used Windows to write and test your code because we mostly use Unix based machines for marking (e.g. Ubuntu, MacOS). \n",
    "\n",
    "There is no single correct answer on what your accuracy should be, but correct implementations usually achieve F1-scores around 80\\% or higher. The quality of the analysis of the results and discussion is as important as the implementation and accuracy of your models. Please be brief and consice in your discussion and analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will be marked out of 30. It is worth 30\\% of your final grade in the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deadline for this assignment is **15:00 on Thursday, 3 Apr 2025** and it needs to be submitted via Blackboard. Standard departmental penalties for lateness will be applied. We use a range of strategies to **detect [unfair means](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/ssid/unfair-means/index)**, including Turnitin which helps detect plagiarism. Use of unfair means would result in getting a failing grade. Use of GenAI is not permitted for this assignment and will be considered as use of unfair means.\n",

    "To choose the model hyperparameters, several configurations were tested and evaluated based on training/validation loss trends and final classification metrics on the test set. The learning rate was set to 0.001 as it is a widely used starting point that offers a good balance between convergence speed and stability. A lower learning rate ensures that the model learns gradually without overshooting the loss minimum. A dropout rate of 0.2 was used to prevent overfitting by randomly disabling 20% of the neurons during training. This rate was selected to introduce regularization without excessively weakening the learning capacity of the network. For the architecture, a hidden layer of size 128 was used 'hidden_dim = [128]' , as models without a hidden layer performed worse, and this configuration allowed the model to capture more abstract features from the input. The number of epochs was set to 100, but early stopping with a tolerance of 0.01 was implemented to halt training once validation loss stopped improving. This approach prevented overfitting and reduced unnecessary computation. Since the training used online (instance-wise) updates, batch size was not applicable. The selected hyperparameters provided a strong balance between performance and efficiency, leading to good generalization as reflected in the high accuracy and F1-score on the test set "
